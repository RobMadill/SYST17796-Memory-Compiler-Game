<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project was the final assignment of my Fundamentals of Software Design course at Sherian College. The objective was to collaborate as a team to design and develop a card game called Memory while adhering to all Object-Oriented design principles.<br><br>
Memory tests your ability to remember cards and their location within a grid. Two players are presented with a list of rules followed by a deck of cards shuffled and dealt out in a 4x13 grid. A, B, C, D will be our rows and 1-13 will be our columns. The goal is to match two cards in the grid with the same value and suit.
<br><br>
This project was developed using Java with the intent of applying Object-Oriented design principles. Java’s support with classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism allowed us to easily showcase these core concepts. We utilized various design patterns, such as the Singleton pattern for our GroupOfCards class as well as the Factory pattern to create instances of different objects such as PlayingCard and Game. Additionally, the project implemented the use of Enum classes for type safety.

### Built With

* [Java - JDK 15.0](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk15-archive-downloads.html)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
### Rules:
1. The deck of cards is shuffled and dealt out in a 4x13 grid. A,B,C & D will be our rows. 1-13 will be our columns.
2. The players each take turns flipping the cards over.
3. If the cards are both the same value and color then it's a match.
4. If the cards are not a match, then its the opponents turn.

#### After launch:

#### Enter in player names:

#### After player one's first turn:

#### After a player scored:

#### This will continue until the whole grid is cleared and will show the final score as well as a message asking if the players would like to play again!
