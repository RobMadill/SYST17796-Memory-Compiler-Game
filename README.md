# SYST17796-Memory-Compiler-Game
Final project for SYST17796 course at Sheridan College. 

Memory is a 2 player compiler card game.

Memory has a set of rules:
1. The deck of cards is shuffled and dealt out in a 4x13 grid. A,B,C & D will be our rows. 1-13 will be our columns.
2. The players each take turns flipping the cards over.
3. If the cards are both the same value and color then it's a match.
4. If the cards are not a match, then its the opponents turn.
