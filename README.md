# SYST17796-Memory-Compiler-Game
This was a card game that was developed for SYST17796 - Fundamentals of Software Design at Sheridan College. 
As team lead, it was my responsibility to keep my team on track and to meet strict deadlines. 
This card game showed myself and my team how Object Oriented Programming could be applied with a simple card game using a MVC design pattern

Memory is a 2 player compiler card game.

Memory has a set of rules:
1. The deck of cards is shuffled and dealt out in a 4x13 grid. A,B,C & D will be our rows. 1-13 will be our columns.
2. The players each take turns flipping the cards over.
3. If the cards are both the same value and color then it's a match.
4. If the cards are not a match, then its the opponents turn.
